This guide covers the main elements in your `.qmd` survey file as well as how to add content to your survey, like pages, questions, etc.

# Start with a template

In the R console, run the following to to setup a template survey:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_create_survey("path/to/folder")
```

This will create a folder located at `"path/to/folder"` with the following files:

- `example.qmd`: a template survey you should edit.
- `example.Rproj`: An RStudio project file (helpful if you're working in RStudio)
- `_extensions`: A folder with the [surveydown Quarto extension](https://github.com/jhelvy/surveydown-ext) needed to make everything work (don't modify this).

> Every survey created with {surveydown} should be in its own separate project folder.

# Survey components

Every {surveydown} survey is configured in a single `.qmd` file that consists of **4 parts**: 

1. The YAML header.
2. The setup code chunk.
3. The survey body. 
4. The server code chunk. 

```{r out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survey-screenshot.png")
```

# 1. YAML Header

The YAML header is at the top of the `.qmd` file. In addition to two required elements, the YAML can be used to set the survey theme as well as modify the survey progress bar. 

## Required YAML content

For a surveydown survey, your YAML must contain at least the following:

``` yaml
---
server: shiny
filters: [surveydown]
---
```

The `server: shiny` part ensures that the document will render as a shiny app. The `filters: [surveydown]` part applies the surveydown Quarto extension to the project, which is required.

## Setitng the theme 

The YAML can also be used to set several **optional** global settings, such as the overall survey `theme`:

``` yaml
---
theme: united # Any bootswatch theme 
---
```

There are [25 bootswatch themes](https://bootswatch.com) to choose from. You can also provide a `custom.scss` file to further modify the theme, or even combine the two, e.g.:

``` yaml
---
theme: [united, custom.scss]
---
```

## Progress bar

You can modify the survey progress bar with the `barcolor` and `barposition` keys, e.g.:

``` yaml
---
barcolor: theme 
barposition: top 
---
```

The `barcolor` key defines the color of the progress bar. It defaults to `theme`, meaning it will take the primary theme color. You may also use any hex code to overwrite this color as you wish, e.g.: `#768692`.

The `barposition` key defines the position of the progress bar. It defaults to `top`, but can also be changed to `bottom` or `none` (to remove the bar). The progress bar updates on every **question** the user clicks on, not pages.

# 2. Setup code chunk

After the YAML header, you'll need to load the `surveydown` package and run the `sd_setup()` function. This should be placed inside a code chunk that looks like this:

````
`r ''````{r}
#| context: setup
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load the package
library(surveydown)

# Run initial setup function (essential - do not delete)
sd_setup()
```
````

Anything loaded in the setup chunk is accessible in both your survey body and your server, so we recommend also loading other packages and / or data in this chunk as well. 

# 3. Survey body

The survey body is all the content in between your setup code chunk and your server code chunk. You can use markdown (or the RStudio visual editor) to insert text, images, etc. just like you would in any Quarto document. 

The unique elements to a surveydown survey are **pages**, **navigation buttons**, and **questions**.

## Adding pages

In surveydown, pages are defined using fences (`:::`), like this:

```
::: {#welcome .sd-page}

Page 1 content here

:::

::: {#page2 .sd-page}

Page 2 content here

:::
```

As you can see, we use three colon symbols `:::`, called a "fence", to mark the start and end of pages. This notation is commonly used in Quarto for a variety of use cases, like defining [subfigures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures) in images.

In the starting fence, you need to define a page name (e.g. `welcome` and `page2` in the example above) and you need to define the class as `.sd-page`. Then anything you put between the page fences will appear on that page. 

## Adding navigation buttons

To navigate to the next page, you need to insert a `sd_next()` function call inside a code chunk, like this: 

````
`r ''````{r}
sd_next(next_page = 'page2')
```
````

The above code chunk will create a "Next" button that goes on to page 2 that looks like this:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

sd_next(next_page = 'page2')
```

In this example, the next button has to be inserted in a code chunk in between the `:::` fences of the `welcome` page in order to have a "Next" button that goes on to page 2. You can also send the user to other pages by just changing the value assigned to the `next_page` argument. 

Finally, you can also change the label of the button by changing the `label` argument, like this:

````
`r ''````{r}
sd_next(next_page = 'page2', label = 'Next page')
```
````

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

sd_next(next_page = 'page2', label = 'Next page')
```

## Adding questions

Every survey question is created using the `sd_question()` function inside a code chunk. The question type is defined by the `type` argument. For example, to add a multiple choice question, you could insert the following code chunk:

````
`r ''````{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'penguins',
  label = "Which is your favorite type of penguin?",
  option = c(
    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',
    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',
    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'
  )
)
```
````

The above code chunk will create a multiple choice question that looks like this:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'penguins',
  label = "Which is your favorite type of penguin?",
  option = c(
    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',
    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',
    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'
  )
)
```

<br>

The `sd_question()` function can be used to create a variety of question types, like text input, select drop down choices, and more by changing the `type` argument (see `vignette("questions")`).

The function has many other arguments for customizing the look and feel of the question, such as the `height` and `width` (see `vignette("formatting")`).

Finally, `sd_question()` has a `required` argument that can be used to make a question required or optional (e.g., `required = TRUE`). The default is `FALSE`, meaning the question is optional.

# 4. Server code chunk

At the very bottom of the .qmd file is a special "server" code chunk (that's the `#| context: server` bit) that defines the app server. This is where you can customize and control the survey flow logic as well as where you define the database that will store the survey response data. It looks like this:

````
`r ''````{r}
#| context: server

# Define the configuration settings
config <- sd_config()

# Define the database settings
db <- sd_database()

# The sd_server() function initiates your survey - don't change this
sd_server(
  input   = input,
  session = session,
  config  = config,
  db      = db
)
```
````

The `sd_config()` function is where you can define configuration options for the survey, such as *conditional display* (conditionally displaying a question based on responses to questions), or *conditional skip* (conditionally sending the respondent to a page based on responses to questions). See `vignette("config")` for details.

The `sd_database()` function is where you set up your database. See `vignette("database")` for details.

The `sd_server()` function at the bottom makes everything run, which you can safely ignore - just don't change it and all will be good!
