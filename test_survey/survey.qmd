# Template - Choice-based-conjoint Survey

::: {.callout-note}

There are two versions of the conjoint survey: "button" and "table". This is the "**button**" version.

In this version, the conjoint options are shown in buttons.

:::

This is a template of choice-based-conjoint survey. For this survey, we will ask you about your preferences for different types of apples.

::: {.sd_page id=consent}

# Consent

This survey is being conducted by students at The George Washing University. We will not be collecting any identifying data, such as your name or address. The whole survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Your participation is voluntary and you may stop the survey at any time.

If you would like to participate, please answer the following questions:

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'consent_age',
  label = "I am age 18 or older",
  option = c(
    'Yes' = 'yes',
    'No'  = 'no'
  )
)

sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'consent_understand',
  label = "I have read and understand the above information",
  option = c(
    'Yes' = 'yes',
    'No'  = 'no'
  )
)

sd_next()
```

# Favorite Fruit

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'like_fruit',
  label = "Do you like fruit?",
  option = c(
    'Yes!'    = 'yes',
    'Kind of' = 'kind_of',
    'No :('   = 'no'
  )
)

sd_question(
  type  = 'text',
  id    = 'fav_fruit',
  label = "What is your favorite fruit?"
)

sd_next()
```

::: {.sd_page id=screening}

# Screening Questions

For this example, I'm using the response here to screen out respondents - I'm only interested in people who choose **"Red"**, so if you choose "Blue" you'll be screened out.

Usually you would not tell respondents ahead of time how they will be screened - I'm just putting an explanation here since this whole survey is for demonstration purposes

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'screenout',
  label = "Before we go on, please select which color you prefer between these two:",
  option = c(
    'Blue' = 'blue',
    'Red'  = 'red'
  )
)

sd_next()

# Educational Page

Great work! 

Now that you've shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider a shopping scenario in which you can choose some apples to purchase from a set of apples with different attributes.

Let's learn about these attributes.

## Price

Price refers to the full price you will pay (including taxes) for the apples

## Freshness

The freshness of the apple will be presented as one of three different categories:

- **Excellent**: No bruising or marks. 
- **Average**: One or two light bruises. 
- **Poor**: Multiple bruises and marks.

## Type

We will show five different types of apples:

<div style="width: 500px;">

Fuji | Gala | Honeycrisp | Pink Lady | Red Delicious
-----|------|------------|-----------|--------------
<img src="images/fuji.jpg" width=100> | <img src="images/gala.jpg" width=100> | <img src="images/honeycrisp.jpg" width=100> | <img src="images/pinkLady.jpg" width=100> | <img src="images/redDelicious.jpg" width=100>

</div>

# Choice-based Conjoint (cbc) Practice

We'll now begin the choice tasks. On the next few pages we will show you three options of apples and we'll ask you to choose the one you most prefer.

```{r}
# Define the option vector

apple_buttons_option <- c("option_1", "option_2", "option_3")

# Change the names of each element to display markdown-formatted
# text and an embedded image using html

names(apple_buttons_option)[1] <- "
  **Option 1**<br>
  <img src='images/fuji.jpg' width=100><br>
  **Type**: Fuji<br>
  **Price**: $ 2 / lb<br>
  **Freshness**: Average
"
names(apple_buttons_option)[2] <- "
  **Option 2**<br>
  <img src='images/pinkLady.jpg' width=100><br>
  **Type**: Pink Lady<br>
