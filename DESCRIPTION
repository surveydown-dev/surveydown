Description: Generate programmable surveys using markdown and R code chunks. Surveys
    are composed of two files: a survey.qmd 'Quarto' file defining the
    survey content (pages, questions, etc), and an app.R file defining a
    'shiny' app with global settings (libraries, database configuration,
    etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional skipping /
    display, etc.). Survey data collected from respondents is stored in a
    'PostgreSQL' database. Features include controls for conditional skip
    logic (skip to a page based on an answer to a question), conditional
    display logic (display a question based on an answer to a question), a
    customizable progress bar, and a wide variety of question types,
    including multiple choice (single choice and multiple choices),
    select, text, numeric, multiple choice buttons, text area, and dates.
    Because the surveys render into a 'shiny' app, designers can also
    leverage the reactive capabilities of 'shiny' to create dynamic and
    interactive surveys.
