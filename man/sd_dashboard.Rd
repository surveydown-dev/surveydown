\usage{
sd_dashboard(gssencmode = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{gssencmode}{Character string. The GSS encryption mode for the database
connection. Defaults to \code{"auto"}. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"auto"}: Tries \code{"prefer"} first, then falls back to \code{"disable"} if GSSAPI negotiation fails
\item \code{"prefer"}: Uses GSSAPI encryption if available, plain connection otherwise
\item \code{"disable"}: Disables GSSAPI encryption entirely
Set to \code{"disable"} if you're having connection issues on a secure connection like a VPN.
}}
}
\description{
This dashboard was depreciated in version v0.13.0. Now the sdstudio package
fully includes the functionality that was previously included in this function.
