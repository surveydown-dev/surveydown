In the R console, run the following to to setup a template survey:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
surveydown::sd_create_survey("path/to/folder")
```

This will create a folder located at `"path/to/folder"` with the following files:

- `example.qmd`: a template survey you should edit.
- `example.Rproj`: An RStudio project file (helpful if you're working in RStudio)
- `_extensions`: A folder with the [surveydown Quarto extension](https://github.com/jhelvy/surveydown-ext) needed to make everything work (don't modify this).
