\description{
This function is deprecated. Please use \code{sd_skip_if()} instead.

This function is used to define conditions under which certain pages in the
survey should be skipped ahead to (forward only). It takes one or more formulas
where the left-hand side is the condition and the right-hand side is the target page ID.
